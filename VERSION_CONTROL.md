# Version Control & Release Management

## **Semantic Versioning Strategy**

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) for consistent and predictable version management:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3)
```

### Version Bump Rules
- **MAJOR (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)**: Breaking changes, incompatible API changes, major architecture shifts
- **MINOR (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)**: New features, enhancements, backward compatible additions
- **PATCH (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)**: Bug fixes, security patches, backward compatible fixes

### Pre-release Versions
- **Alpha**: `1.0.0-alpha.1` - Early development, unstable
- **Beta**: `1.0.0-beta.1` - Feature complete, testing phase
- **Release Candidate**: `1.0.0-rc.1` - Final testing before release

## 🌳 **Git Branch Strategy**

### Branch Hierarchy
```
main (production)
├── develop (integration)
├── feature/ai-improvements
├── feature/family-sharing
├── hotfix/critical-camera-fix
└── release/v1.1.0
```

### Branch Types & Purposes

#### Production Branches
- **`main`**: Production-ready code, protected branch, auto-deploys to production
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features, deploys to staging environment

#### Supporting Branches
- **`feature/*`**: Individual feature development (e.g., `feature/gift-shop-enhancement`)
- **`release/*`**: Version preparation and final testing (e.g., `release/v1.1.0`)
- **`hotfix/*`**: Critical production fixes (e.g., `hotfix/camera-crash-fix`)

### Branch Naming Conventions
```bash
feature/descriptive-feature-name
hotfix/brief-fix-description
release/v1.2.0
bugfix/specific-bug-description
```

## **Detailed Release Process**

### 1. Feature Development Workflow

#### Starting a New Feature
```bash
# Ensure develop is up to date
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-ai-training-system

# Develop the feature
# ... code, test, commit ...

# Keep feature branch updated
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/new-ai-training-system
git merge develop

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/new-ai-training-system
```

#### Feature Integration
```bash
# Create Pull Request to develop
# Code review and testing
# Merge to develop (squash commits for clean history)
```

### 2. Release Preparation Workflow

#### Creating a Release Branch
```bash
# Start from updated develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.1.0

# Update version in package.json
npm run version:minor

# Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
# Add release date and finalize features list

# Run comprehensive testing
npm run release:check

# Commit version changes
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: prepare release v1.1.0

- Bump version to 1.1.0
- Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
- Ready for production deployment"

# Push release branch
git push origin release/v1.1.0
```

#### Release Testing & Validation
```bash
# Deploy to staging for final testing
npm run release:staging

# Run manual testing checklist
# - PWA installation works
# - Camera functionality
# - Species recognition accuracy
# - Gift shop transactions
# - Offline functionality
# - Performance testing

# Address any critical issues found
# ... fix bugs, commit changes ...
```

### 3. Production Release Workflow

#### Finalizing the Release
```bash
# Create Pull Request from release/v1.1.0 to main
# Final code review and approval

# Merge to main (create merge commit)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff release/v1.1.0

# Create annotated release tag
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release v1.1.0 - Enhanced AI Features

Major improvements:
- Improved species recognition accuracy
- New family sharing features
- Enhanced PWA performance
- Bug fixes and optimizations"

# Push main with tags
git push origin main --tags
```

#### Post-Release Activities
```bash
# Merge changes back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop

# Delete release branch (locally and remotely)
git branch -d release/v1.1.0
git push origin --delete release/v1.1.0

# Deploy to production (automatic via main branch)
# Monitor deployment and application health
```

### 4. Hotfix Process for Critical Issues

#### Emergency Hotfix Workflow
```bash
# Create hotfix from main (production)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/camera-memory-leak

# Fix the critical issue
# ... implement fix, test thoroughly ...

# Update version (patch increment)
npm run version:patch

# Update CHANGELOG.md with hotfix details
git add package.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "fix: resolve camera memory leak causing app crashes

- Fix memory leak in camera cleanup process
- Add proper error handling for camera permissions
- Improve camera lifecycle management

Fixes #123"

# Push hotfix branch
git push origin hotfix/camera-memory-leak

# Create PR to main for immediate deployment
# Emergency review and testing

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/camera-memory-leak
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin main --tags

# Merge to develop to include fix in future releases
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop

# Delete hotfix branch
git branch -d hotfix/camera-memory-leak
git push origin --delete hotfix/camera-memory-leak
```
